### Title - Blood Bank Management System
#### Problem Statement - 
##### People die due to lack of donated blood. Donors are available but not at the right place or the seeker cannot find blood at the right time. Problem solved by creating a program in Python-MySQL Connectivity. Old Blood banking systems donâ€™t follow the actual needs of users.

# Blood Bank Management System

This project is a Blood Bank Management System developed using Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to streamline the process of blood donation by providing a centralized platform for donors, patients, hospitals, and blood banks.

# Functions

## Admin
- To create an admin account, use the following command:
  ```bash
  py manage.py createsuperuser
  ```
- Upon login, the admin can view the unit of blood for each blood group, number of donors, blood requests, approved requests, and total blood units on the dashboard.
- Admin has CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for donors and patients.
- Admin can approve or reject donation requests, which affect the blood stock accordingly.
- Admin can approve or reject blood requests, which also impact the blood stock.
- Admin can view the history of blood requests and update the units of a particular blood group.

## Donor
- Donors can create accounts with basic details.
- After login, donors can donate blood, pending approval from admin.
- Donors can view their donation history and blood request status.

## Patient
- Patients can create accounts without admin approval.
- Upon login, patients can request blood of specific blood groups and units.
- Patients can view their blood request history with statuses.
